# Fantasy Word Sprint

A web-based application designed for writers to enhance their productivity through timed writing sprints. This tool provides a fun and focused environment for fantasy writers to engage in word sprints while enjoying a fantasy-themed interface.
I am making this tool for writers to use for free. Any help with improvements would be appreciated.
